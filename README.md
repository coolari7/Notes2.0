# Notes2.0

The previous repo of the notes was haphazard, unorganized and thoughtless. 
Owing to the need of a complete refactor, this new repo has been created.
Here are the guidelines:

* A **topic** falls under the purview of one of the following list items:

   * Programming Language
   * npm package

* Each topic will have its own branch (eg. Express).
* If a subject/procedure needs to be documented but doesn't fall under the definition of a topic (as mentioned above), it will be placed within the **others** branch, in it's own folder.
* The names of branches and folders inside **others** will be hyphen-lowercased (eg. express, express-typescript-starter).

* **Notes will be in the form of README.md**
* Unused branches will **strictly** have to be cleared.
