# Notes2.0

The previous repo of the notes was haphazard, unorganized and thoughtless. 
Owing to the need of a complete refactor, this new repo has been created.
Here are the guidelines:

* Each topic will have its own branch.
* Branch names will be camelCased.
* If topics fall under similar categories, the naming criteria mentioned below will be followed:

> **groupName-subGroupName-...-topicName**

* **Notes will be in the form of README.md**
* Unused branches will **strictly** have to be cleared.
